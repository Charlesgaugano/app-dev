** Fast&Furious **
1. The first movie, The Fast and the Furious (2001), was inspired by a Vibe magazine article about illegal street racing in New York City.
2. While the original movie centered around racing, the franchise quickly evolved into a series featuring heists, international espionage, and action-packed stunts.
3. Paul Walker, who played Brian O'Conner, tragically passed away in a car accident in 2013 during the filming of Furious 7.
